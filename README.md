Constraint-based sketcher addon for [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) that allows to create precise 2d shapes by defining a set of geometric constraints like tangent, distance, angle, equal and more. Sketches stay editable and support a fully non-destructive workflow.

> :warning: **Experimental addon:** This is still work in progress, don't use it on production files without a backup.

Minimum version: Blender 2.92
